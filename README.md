Dodo Scraper is an app that compiles the latest articles from thedodo.com, a website geared towards animal lovers that shares cute, funny, 
and poignant stories and videos about all types of animals.

Users can hit the "scrape" button and the titles, links, and blurbs of the articles most recently posted by The Dodo will appear. The user
may also add and save notes to each story, while reading notes left by others.

This app was created using a variety of technologies, including MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, Handlebars, Cheerio, Axios, Request, HTML, CSS 
Javascript, and jQuery.

For future deployment I would add more data to each entry, such as photos and videos.
